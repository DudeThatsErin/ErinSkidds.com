        <li>Andrew Appleton (CEO and Founder) reached out to me to get his website maintained by me. He had the theme partially set up, but it was a mess, and I helped him get it to the point where it is today.I had to code a lot of different scripts and pages from scratch and change a few different items on the website to match what he wanted. It was a unique experience that challenged me.</li>
